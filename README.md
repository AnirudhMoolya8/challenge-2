# Getting Started with this scraper!

If you want the live site: https://scraper-challenge-2.netlify.app/

Otherwise, if you want to download and edit it in your own personal environment:

Just clone this repo and make sure to use npm to install ```@mui/material``` and ```@mui/x-data-grid```.

This can be done like this:

```npm install @mui/material @mui/x-data-grid```

Then just type ```npm start``` and run!

If you're using nodemon, then: ```npm install nodemon```. When starting: ```npm start nodemon website```


The code does use the Github API, but it does not require any tokens.
